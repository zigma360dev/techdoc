# About

The Zigma360 TechDoc is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.

It requires a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the Python package manager, [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/), to be installed on your system.

Documentation source files are written in **Markdown**, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Start by reading the [introductory tutorial](getting-started.md), then check the User Guide for more information.
